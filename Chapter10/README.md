# Chapter10

Welcome to your new Chapter10 FUSEE App generated by the `dotnet new fusee` command.

`Chapter10.cs` contains the source code for a working FUSEE application showing 
a 3D rocket model. Alter the source code of `Chapter10.cs` to match your needs 
and/or add additional source code files to this directory.

Add any assets to be deployed with your app, such as images (.png, .jpg), 
3D models (.fus), font files (.ttf) or shaders (.vert, .frag) 
to the `Assets` sub folder.
